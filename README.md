# Empirical-Method-in-Finance
Winter 2020  Course description: Econometric and statistical techniques commonly used in quantitative finance. Use of estimation application software in exercises to estimate volatility, correlations, stability, regressions, and statistical inference using financial time series.  Topic 1: Time series properties of stock market returns and prices  
 Class intro: Forecasting and Finance  
 The random walk hypothesis  
 Stationarity  
 Time-varying volatility and General Least Squares  
 Robust standard errors and OLS  
Topic 2: Time-dependence and predictability  
 ARMA models  
 The likelihood function, exact and conditional likelihood estimation  
 Predictive regressions, autocorrelation robust standard errors  
 The Campbell-Shiller decomposition  
 Present value restrictions  
 Multivariate analysis: Vector Autoregression (VAR) models, the Kalman Filter  
Topic 3: Heteroscedasticity  
 Time-varying volatility in the data  
 Realized Variance  
 ARCH and GARCH models, application to Value-at-Risk  
Topic 4: Time series properties of the cross-section of stock returns  
 Single- and multifactor models  
 Economic factors: Models and data exploration  
 Statistical factors: Principal Components Analysis  
 Fama-MacBeth regressions and characteristics-based factors
